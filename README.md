My personal portfolio website designed and built by me ✨ <br>
The goal is for my portfolio website to be visually unique and really reflect my personal style and personality.

## Background

This project was designed using Figma, Photoshop, and Affinity Designer. The website was built using JS / HTML / CSS.

The initial style guide I created for myself, including the simple four-pointed star graphic I use throughout the site.

Here is the full home page. I wanted the three main sections to be accessible in one continuous scroll while still maintaining easy navigation between the sections with the sticky navigation bar.

I experimented with CSS gradients to produce the final result of the home page banner with some more colors, and stars that have a faint glow ✨

The project page is more vague, as each project will have its own organizational structure, but I still wanted a visual reference for how to separate out the sections and present the information.

I also had fun with hover effects and transitions to make the site more dynamic as the user moves through the sections.
